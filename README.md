- [get_latim_tags](https://github.com/vitor-mafra/automating_boring_stuff/blob/master/get_tags_latim.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook made for a friend who studies Linguistics.

-[homestuck_albums_scraper](https://github.com/vitor-mafra/automating_boring_stuff/tree/master/homestuck_albums_scraper) is a Python script I've made for a friend (@caioguedesam) who is a huge fan of [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/). With Adobe Flash Player discontinuity, fans of this webcomic are making what they can to save as much Homestuck's data as they can - which is the case of this script. In a nutshell, it crawl's a fanmade website and download all the pictures related to Homestuck's music
